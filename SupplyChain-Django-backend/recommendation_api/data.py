The fruits mature within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp. The colour of the skin at maturity ranges from yellow-red depending on the variety. However, the optimum time of harvest depends on fruit quality and intended period of storage. Due to the introduction of dwarf rootstock hand picking is recommended as it reduces bruising due to fruit fall during mechanical harvesting."],

For long distance transportation, harvesting is done at 75-80 % maturity.  The fruit is climacteric and can reach consumption stage after ripening operation. The planted crop gets ready for harvest within 12-15 months of planting and the main harvesting season of banana is from September to April.  Bunches attain maturity from 90-150 days after flowering depending upon variety, soil, weather condition and elevation. Bunch should be harvested when fingers of second hand from top are 3/4 rounded with the help of sharp sickle 30cm above the first hand. Harvest may be delayed upto 100-110 days after opening of the first hand. Harvested bunch should generally be collected in well padded tray or basket and brought to collection site. Bunches should be kept out of light after harvest, since this hastens ripening and softening. For local consumption, hands are often left on stalks and sold to retailers."],

This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt."],

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation.

When the plants are about 15–20 cm tall, they are thinned out. About four months after planting, harvesting begins. The plants are usually harvested after they flower, before the flowers go to seed. The stalks are cut off close to the ground. The stalks are tied into bundles and soaked in water for about 20 days. This process softens the tissues and breaks the hard [pectin] bond between the bast and [Jute hurd] (inner woody fiber stick) and the process permits the fibres to be separated.

In Punjab, as many as five flushes are produced from April-August. April and Mayflushes being found most heavy. In South India, mango usually gives two growth flushes, one in February-June and the other in October-November. In mango about 8-10 months old shoots under certain conditions cease to grow at least 4 months prior to blossoming. These shoots are capable of producing flower buds. Other shoots, which appear in subsequent flushes during late monsoon, do not come to flowering. These shoots flower during the next season after accumulating sufficient metabolites necessary for fruit-bud differentiation.

Farmers use the same type of combine machinery used to harvest soybeans, but because mung beans are smaller than soybeans, they adjust the combine settings and screen size for the smaller bean size. Mung beans should be cleaned of debris before storage, and the beans should have no more than 12 percent moisture content for storage. Because harvested beans may be sprouted and eaten directly, stored beans should not be treated with fungicides, insecticides or bactericides."],
